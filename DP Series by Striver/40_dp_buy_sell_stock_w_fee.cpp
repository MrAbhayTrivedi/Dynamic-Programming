/*
Buy and Sell Stocks With Transaction Fees

We are given an array Arr[] of length n. It represents the price of a stock on ‘n’ days. The following guidelines need to be followed:

    -> We can buy and sell the stock any number of times.
    -> In order to sell the stock, we need to first buy it on the same or any previous day.
    -> We can’t buy a stock again after buying it once. In other words, we first buy a stock and then sell it. After selling we can buy and sell again. But we can’t sell before buying and can’t buy before selling any previously bought stock.
    -> After every transaction, there is a transaction fee (‘fee’) associated with it.

Example:
Arr:[1,3,2,8,4,9]
N=6
fee=2
Max Profit = 8=(5(8-1-2)+3(9-4-2))

Solution: Everything is similar to dp36 except a fee per transaction is added which can be subtracted from total profit of each transaction.
